# Awesome-Signature-Verification
A curated, non-exhaustive list of papers and related resources in handwritten signature verification using ML/DL techniques.

Associated blog post: [Handwritten Signature Verification](https://heartbeat.comet.ml/handwritten-signature-verification-9f7f9c5df008)

> This collection will be frequently updated with newer papers. Otherwise, please feel free to submit a PR for a quicker inclusion of papers !

<b>Note:</b> Since this is a vast domain with sufficiently large number of published papers over the years, it is not possible and also somewhat inconvenient for the readers to provide such a near-exhaustive collection. Thus, this list only constitutes the more recent (2016 onwards) and typically those papers that have been published in reputed venues. For a basic understanding, readers are reccomended to first go through some of the survey papers cited below.
